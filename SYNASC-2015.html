    <h2>Web app security using JSFlow</h2>

    <p>
        This page contains information to get you experimenting with enforcing confidentiality of user data using JSFlow.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you want to play with JSFlow in the browser you can download an (unreleased) experimental version that runs
        in Firefox. This version might be unstable, since it is under development. The official release of JSFlow which will soon include the Firefox extension, Tortoise. <i>If you find bugs we
        appreciate if you report them to us!</i>

    <div class="row" align="center">
        <a class="btn btn-primary btn-large" href="SYNASC-2015/tortoise.xpi">Downlod Tortoise</a>
    </div>


    <p>Please note that due to fast changing internal security models of Firefox, Tortoise is not guaranteed to work in newer (or older)
        versions of Firefox. We develop Tortoise on <a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/30.0/">Firefox
            30</a>.

    <p> You might be interested in the <a href="SYNASC-2015/slides.pdf">slides</a> for the tutorial.

        If you want to download the source of JSFlow or play around with the online interpreter the head over to <a
                href="http://www.jsflow.net">jsflow.net</a>

    <h3> Setup for injection challenges </h3>

    <p>
        Before you start you need to download Node.js from <a
            href="http://nodejs.org">nodejs.org</a>. The Hrafn app, the ad service
        and the analytics service are built using the <a
            href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> web framework. You also need
        to download the <a href="SYNASC-2015/hrafn.zip">source code</a> for Hrafn and the
        other services.

    <p>
        Once you are set you should see something like the following if you execute <code>node -v</code>
<pre>$ node -v
v0.12.2</pre>

    <p> Just to make sure that you have npm as well
<pre>$ npm -v
2.7.4</pre>

    <p> If you unzip hrafn.zip you should get three directories
<pre>
hrafn/server
hrafn/adserv
hrafn/analytics</pre>

    <h4>hrafn/server</h4>
    The server of the main app. Before it can be started the JavaScript libraries it uses must be downloaded and
    installed. You do this with <code>npm install</code> which should result in something like this
          
<pre>$npm install
passport-local@1.0.0 node_modules/passport-local
└── passport-strategy@1.0.0

passport@0.2.2 node_modules/passport
├── pause@0.0.1
└── passport-strategy@1.0.0
...
</pre>

    <p>Don't worry - nothing will be installed on the system. It's all downloaded into the directory of the app itself.
        Once the dependencies have been installed you start the server with <code>node index.js</code> which should give

<pre>$ node index.js 
Node app is running on port 5000
</pre>

    <p> indicating that the server is running and bound to port 5000. You can now browse to <a
            href="http://localhost:5000">http://localhost:5000</a> and get Hrafn; of course since we are not running the
        ad service or the analytics service those won't work.


    <h4>hrafn/adserv</h4>
    The ad service used by Hrafn. Again you need to run <code>npm install</code> before you can run <code>node
    adserv.js</code> which should give
<pre>$ node adserv.js 
Node app is running on port 4999</pre>

    <p> indicating that the server is running and bound to port 4999.

    <h4>hrafn/analytics</h4>
    The analytics service used by Hrafn. Again you need to run <code>npm install</code> before you can run <code>node
    analytics.js</code> which should give
<pre>$ node analytics.js 
Node app is running on port 4888</pre>

    <p> indicating that the server is running and bound to port 4888.

    <h4>Putting it all together</h4>
    Now, if you start all three servers in different console windows you should now be able to
    play with a working version of <a href="http://localhost:5000">Hrafn</a>!

    <h3>The injection attacks </h3>

    <p>
        Your challenge is
        to implement the two injection attacks we introduced during the
        tutorial. I have also included an additional similar challenge based on control of the analytics server. For the two first challenges the solution can be found in the
    <a href="SYNASC-2015/slides.pdf">slides</a>.
</div>

<div class="container">
    <h4>The ad injection attack</h4>
    This attack involves creating a new ad that injects code to steal the
    credential and send it back to the attacker. There are two main
    challenges. First, with the risk of giving too much information away - note
    that scripts injected by modifying <em>innerHTML</em> creates a script
    node but does not automatically execute it. Second, where will you send the
    stolen credentials? You are not allowed to change the code of the ad server.

    <p>
        Files that you are allowed to modify
    <ul>
        <li>hrafn/adserv/ads/*</li>
        <li>hrafn/adserv/public/ads/*</li>
    </ul>

    <p> Note that the adserver serves the ads in the <em>hrafn/adserv/ads/</em> directory
        in a round robin fashion in the order provided by the OS. </p>
    <p>
        If you want, you can download the <a href="SYNASC-2015/malicious-ad.zip">solution</a>.

    </p>

</div>

<hr>


<div class="container">
    <h4>The XSS attack</h4>

    The XSS attack is the most powerful one, since it does not require control of any of the services. In fact, since
    Hrafn allows you to post anonymously you don't even have to have an account. Find a way to craft a message that you
    post on Hrafn and that steals the credentials of subsequent logins. Can you make a user automatically post his
    credentials on Hrafn on login?
    <p>
        Files that you are allowed to modify
    <ul>
        <li>None</li>
    </ul>

    If you want, you can download the <a href="SYNASC-2015/cross-site-scripting.zip">solution</a>.

</div>
<hr>

<div class="container">
    <h4>The analytics service injection attack</h4>

    <p>
        The
        simplest attack is the analytics service injection attack, since you are
        in direct control of the code that the analytics server provides. Create an
        attack that sends back the credentials to the analytics server.

    <p>
        Files that you are allowed to modify
    <ul>
        <li>hrafn/analytics/*</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you want, you can download the <a href="SYNASC-2015/cross-site-scripting.zip">solution</a>.

    <h4>Selected works relating to web security and information flow control</h4>


    <p><a href="http://www.owasp.org">Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)</a> is a non-profit organisation
        that contains a lot of interesting information on vulnerabilities and protection mechanism. They also create the
        OWASP Top 10 list that lists the most common vulnerabilities.


    <p>For information about Cross Site Scripting (XSS) head over to <a href="http://www.cgisecurity.com/xss-faq.html">http://www.cgisecurity.com/xss-faq.html</a>.
        OWASP also has a <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet">cheat
            sheet</a> on XSS prevention that illustrates well why the current techniques are complex.


    <p>
        On web sandboxes the article by Politz, Guha, Krishnamurthi gives good background with multiple pointers to the
        sandboxes themselves. It's also a very good article that describes an interesting and impressive endevour to
        verify the correctness of AdSafe. You can also visit their project page for more information, <a
            href="http://www.jswebtools.org/adsafety/">http://www.jswebtools.org/adsafety/</a>.
